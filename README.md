### About
This project attempts to implement service similiar to unix logrotate as windows is insane and doesn't really have a valid equivalent. Also I wanted to play with go. Use at your own peril.

### Config
See configs/wingologrotate.yaml for example config.

### Installation
- place exe in desired directory
- create configs/wingologrotate.yaml in same location
- run wingologrotate.exe install as administrator

### Compatibility
Tested on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019. It should run on any modern windows distribution.
